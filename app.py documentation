# Flask Backend Code: Detailed Function Breakdown

## Imports
- **Flask**: The web framework used to handle HTTP requests and responses.
- **CORS**: Allows cross-origin requests (needed if the frontend is hosted separately from this backend).
- **classify**: A custom function (probably using OpenAI's CLIP or similar) that analyzes an image and returns a classification.

## Initialization
- Initializes the Flask app.
- Enables CORS so the frontend can talk to the backend without getting blocked by browser security policies.

## Core Routes
1. **/users/register (POST)**:
   - Placeholder for user registration logic.
   - Expected to get user data, validate input, store in the database, and return an auth token.
   - Currently returns a static success message.

2. **/users/login (POST)**:
   - Placeholder for user login logic.
   - Should check credentials and return a token if successful.
   - Also just returns a static message for now.

3. **/wardrobe (GET)**:
   - Would return all wardrobe items for a user.
   - Needs user authentication to identify the right wardrobe.
   - Right now, it returns an empty list.

4. **/wardrobe/items (POST)**:
   - Lets users upload clothing images.
   - Uses the `classify(image)` function on each uploaded image to identify it (e.g., "red shirt", "blue jeans").
   - Returns the classification results in a list.

5. **/outfits/generate (POST)**:
   - Placeholder for future outfit generation (e.g., AI suggests a matching outfit).
   - Currently returns an empty outfit.

6. **/outfits (GET)**:
   - Would return saved outfits (if that becomes a feature).
   - Currently returns an empty list.

SUMMARY
- Starts the Flask app in debug mode.
- Helpful during development to auto-reload and show detailed error messages.
- This is a starter backend for a wardrobe/outfit recommendation app.
- Some endpoints are placeholders (e.g., login, register, generate outfit).
- Real logic like authentication, database storage, and AI model integration still needs to be added.
- The `classify()` function is already integrated for image-based clothing recognition.
