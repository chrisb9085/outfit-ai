2. **/get_clothing_data**:
   - Takes a user_id as input.
   - Queries the database for all clothing images associated with the user.
   - Performs a join with the clothing_items table to get metadata.
   - Decodes the binary image data from hexadecimal format.
   - Prints detailed information about each clothing item.
   - Creates Clothing objects with the retrieved data.
   - Returns a list of Clothing objects.

SUMMARY
